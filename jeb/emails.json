I had the opportunity to meet you at the two drug summits and have corresponded with you by email on several issues. Today I am writing you regarding the promise of social entrepreneurship and its place in Florida's progress under your leadership.\n \nYesterday, after a rigorous application process, I was selected as one of four non-profit leaders in Hillsborough and Pinellas Counties to become a fellow in the Denali Initiative. I will receive three years of very high caliber training in how to operate a social enterprise and my organization will receive up to $125,000 in start-up capital for a business venture.  I believe this represents the future of non-profit organizations.  Rather than rely on public funding, we will develop businesses that will allow us to generate our own revenue and become self-reliant. It is a model that has worked extremely well in organizations throughout the country.I believe your interest in privatizing the delivery of services and this model's focus on reducing the non-profit sector's dependence on tax monies are a great fit.\n \nIn the event that you are interested in having someone research the social enterprise model, I am including links to a few informative websites.First is the website for Pioneer Human Services, an extremely successful social enterprise with whom we have consulted. Pioneer serves the same population we serve, although last year in a similarly sized MSA they served 6000 clients while we served 150.  Only a small percentage of their $55 million in revenue comes from government contracts; they generate the rest through their business operations. I am also including a link to the Denali website and the Institute for Social Enterprise website.  Finally, I am also an article from yesterday's Tampa Tribune business section that ran under the headline Nonprofit groups are becoming businesslike. It includes a reference to Tampa Crossroads and our consultation with Pioneer in Seattle.\n \nhttp://www.pioneerhumanserv.com \nhttp://www.denaliinitiative.org \nhttp://www.socialent.org \n \nI have sent in my registration for this year's drug summit and anticipate I will be in Tallahassee February 22 & 23. I would welcome the opportunity to speak with you or a representative about the model and Tampa Crossroads.\nThank you,\nDan Kane",

The cycle of poverty continues and something must be done. I believe\nthe President-elect - however misguided you may think he is - is clearly\ntrying to help reach these children.  Here in Florida the 78 F schools that\nso many said could not improve saw dramatic even radical improvement. All 78\nearned a higher grade because of unprecedented improvement in the reading,\nwriting, and math skills of many students who critics of the accountability\nsystem said could not be expected to learn at the levels needed to give the\nschools a higher grade.

            "message": "Governor,\n\nHere are some ideas on cutting costs and bureaucracy in response to the\nSunday coverage of Governor Bush's goals in the Democrat Dec. 31.  For a\nnational \"first\":\n\n1.  Re-engineer the motor vehicle and vessel regulations to replace the\nsecure title document with a plain paper title, since the electronic\nrecord is now the official record.\n\n2.  Discontinue the annual vehicle and vessel registration and the\nbureaucracies, processes, materials and records required.\n\n3.  Use a very small addition to gasoline taxes to replace the lost\nrevenue for the public stakeholders, state and county governments.  This\nwill spread the cost over highway users, whether or not they reside in or\nown a vehicle in the State of Florida.\n\nGovt. costs eliminated: Tamper-proof secure title paper, $250,000/year,\nplus costs of storage, distribution and inventory control.\t        \t     Mail registration renewal notices, $750,000/year.\t\t        \t     Decals and registration forms, $1,000,000/year\n\nThese estimates are very conservative.  Costs of data collection, storage\nand retrieval are not included, nor costs of program management and problem resolution.\n\nAdditional public benefit: Expired decals will no longer be a matter for\nthe attention of police agencies.\n\nAdditional individual taxpayer benefit: One less governmental procedure\nwith which to comply, and annual savings of $1,000,000 or more for\nregistration (postage, travel or Internet transaction fee) plus cost of\nlate fees and fines for missed registration deadlines.  This could be a high profile reduction in government impact on citizens.\n\nImpact on other stakeholders:  Prison industries (PRIDE) is increasingly\noffering technology services, as the workforce switches from material\nproduction to technology.  Since decals are now being printed as issued\nin county tax collector offices (the new program is about 50% in place)\nPRIDE's role was decreasing anyway.  Manufacturer (3M): Hard to see a\nplus from their point of view.  However, license plate quantities and\nprices seem to increase annually, and they sell the overlay material for\nthat.  However, we should look at reducing tag demand too, perhaps by\nextending the five-year replacement requirement, and allowing tags to\nremain with vehicles through successive owners.  County govts: As\nindicated, fuel taxes could be managed to provide the needed revenues,\nwhile the effort required at the local level is eliminated.  Since tax collectors are taking on responsibilities for issuing driver licenses, this could free up time to lessen any impact of their DL responsibilities.  And, the DL responsibilities will generate county revenue.\n\nI realize this is a rough outline and there may be other considerations I've missed.  Please use or discard as appropriate.  If you'd like someone to discuss this with me, I'm at 488-8290.\n\nRuss Rothman, Chief of Purchasing & Contracts, Dept of Hwy Safety & Mtr Veh\n________________________________________________________________",

I met you with our\ngood friend Coleman Stipanovich; I was his English teacher and a coach\non the football staff when he played at Gainesville High School.\n\nPeople from all over the state have told me my letter cries out for\ndissemination.  I have had K-12, community college, and four year\ncollege teachers call or write me, thanking me for speaking out for\nthem; an insurance man here in town posted the letter in his office;\noverwhelmingly citizens, teachers, and students say I have struck a\nnerve.  So I have sent the letter along to you as well as to John Winn\nand Phil Handy, whom I do not know.

Personally, I am sure\nthey do.\n                              But many of them are not teachers, at\nleast not\n                              in the day in and day out four and five\nclasses a\n                              day sense of the word, and herein lies the\nfertile\n                              ground for an argument I hear growing in\nthis\n                              state.\n\n                              For the purposes of discussion, let's\nassume that\n                              those who promote the K-20 system not only\n\n                              believe in the application of the business\nmodel\n                              to the education system but, more\nimportantly,\n                              believe in the application of the\ncorporate\n                              business model to education. In this\nmodel, the\n                              governor is the CEO of the corporation,\nthe\n                              taxpayers the shareholders, the students\nthe\n                              customers, and the product education.\n\n                              The students and employees I serve see\nthis\n                              analogy as essentially the model for\neducation\n                              that is currently under discussion in this\nstate.\n                              Here are the pros and cons of this model\nas I am\n                              hearing them.\n\n                              For those who believe in this model for\neducation,\n                              the model serves the following purposes:\n\n                              *First, it makes the components of the\nsystem\n                              ultimately accountable to the CEO.\nConsequently,\n                              all power ultimately resides in the CEO.\nThe\n                              governor, appoints and/or approves the\nvarious\n                              boards, even down to the community college\n\n                              boards (for this system is hierarchical\nfrom the\n                              top down).\n\n                              Under the corporate model, the local\nboards no\n                              longer appoint the community college\npresidents.\n                              Instead, the local boards recommend the\n                              presidents up to the CEO or the CEO's\ndesignees,\n                              who then appoint the presidents.\n\n                              Clearly this protocol is efficient in a\ncorporate\n                              model because the CEO is directly\nresponsible to\n                              the shareholders. The CEO's board is the\n                              legislature,\n\n                              but the CEO can control the legislature\ntoo,\n                              especially if it is dominated by the\ngovernor's\n                              party.\n\n                              *Second, the corporate model is attractive\n\n                              because it is universal. In a country\nwhere the\n                              health of the nation is measured by its\ngross\n                              national product, the model appears to\nmake\n                              sense to those whose personal lives are\n                              measured in terms of their contribution to\nthe\n                              total good. In this model, those workers\nwho fail\n                              to contribute to the total good run the\nrisk that\n                              the CEO or his management team will\nreplace\n                              them with those who can contribute.\n\n                              This pressure to produce is constant,\npervasive,\n                              and ubiquitous throughout the culture. The\nfact\n                              that the word customer takes the place of\nthe\n                              word student in the corporate education\nmodel\n                              reflects the degree to which this\nuniversal,\n                              standardized thinking revamps K-20\neducation.\n\n                              *Finally, this cultural obsession with the\nbottom\n                              line, the well-known phrase that justifies\nall\n                              decision making in a corporate model,\nprovides\n                              for a system of accountability.\nAccountability is\n                              attractive to the corporate mind.\n\n                              In athletics (I was once a football coach\non the\n                              staff of a state-ranked high school\nfootball\n                              team), accountability is the be all and\nend all of\n                              every decision made about the sport. On\nthe\n                              field, we reduced accountability to the\nkiller\n                              instinct. Those who had it played; those\nwho\n                              didn't sat on the bench, or else they held\nthe\n                              blocking dummies for those who knew how to\n\n                              win.\n\n                              We coaches called the losers who held the\n                              blocking dummies grunions. A grunion is a\nfish\n                              eaten by a bigger fish so that the bigger\nfish\n                              might live.\n\n                              But when I was a coach, I also taught high\nschool\n                              English. And I soon learned that when I\nreentered\n                              the classroom from the football field, I\nhad to\n                              think differently. And I must confess that\nthe\n                              change in thinking, the change in\nbehavior, the\n                              change in value, was not always easy.\n\n                              Rather than aggressively reward the most\n                              competitive students who reached the goal\nfirst, I\n                              soon realized that the classroom demanded\n                              compassion from me; it even demanded\npatience\n                              from me for those who were not only slower\nthan\n                              I but also for those who were slower than\ntheir\n                              peers.\n\n                              Students who were disadvantaged in the\nmyriad\n                              of ways human beings can be disadvantaged\n                              might be liabilities on the football\nfield, but given\n                              the time to wonder, to discover, to make\n                              mistakes and to learn from those mistakes,\nmany\n                              of them could be assets in the classroom.\n\n                              And yes, we are talking about human beings\n- not\n                              customers. The word customer\noversimplifies\n                              human being just as the word winner or\nloser or\n                              grunion oversimplifies human being.\n\n                              And therein lies the flaw in the corporate\nsystem\n                              as applied to education. Applied too\nbrutally, too\n                              excessively, too efficiently to the system\nof\n                              education -- that experience that happens\nwhen a\n                              teacher walks into a classroom and deals\nwith\n                              formative minds -- the moral of the\nclassroom\n                              deteriorates.\n\n                              To be sure, the community college students\nand\n                              employees I represent do not object to\n                              accountability. Teachers and students hold\neach\n                              other accountable every day. Indeed, to be\na\n                              teacher is to be a learner. And in the\ngreat\n                              moments in the classroom, the relationship\n\n                              between student and teacher is symbiotic,\neach\n                              helping the other to become a better\ncitizen. Not\n                              consumer, but citizen. Education is about\nthe\n                              total human being. It is not just about a\nperson's\n                              athletic skills or a person's ability to\nconsume in\n                              a materialistic society.\n\n                              I am sure that the governor and members of\nthe\n                              Task Force, as well as the members of the\nFlorida\n                              Board of Education, would agree that we\nall want\n                              a first rate educational system. But on\nbehalf of\n                              the students and the community college\n                              employees I represent, we hope that those\n                              directly involved with the reorganization\nof Florida\n                              education will be thoughtful and cautious\nabout\n                              the changes in the system that will\npermanently\n                              affect the quality of our communal lives.\n\n                              Demand excellence; demand achievement;\n                              demand accurate measurements of those\ncriteria.\n                              But be careful about the use of words like\n\n                              \"productivity,\" \"customer\nsatisfaction,\"workforce,\"\n                              \"cost efficient\"; words featured in the\nitemized\n                              goals of the K-20 Education System\ndocument\n                              that informs the changes currently under\n                              discussion in Florida education.\n\n                              If we are not wise about the use of these\nwords,\n                              and consequently their actions, we run the\nrisk of\n                              demeaning and degrading the very process\nwe are\n                              trying to improve.

Jeb Bush\n> \n> Dear Jeb,\n> \n> Greetings and Happy New Year! \n> \n> Below please find a few of things worthy of discussion. If you or a member\n> of your staff would like to pursue this further, please contact Laurie\n> Hammell Crosta (Tel 954.267.2542) to arrange a call. \n> \n> 1) A Florida i-Ambassador Program?  On a recent trip to Dubai, United Arab\n> Emirates, I met with government and business leaders of the Dubai Internet\n> City. This is a well financed, progressive effort to bring Dubai, the UAE\n> and the Middle East into the Web world. My conclusion was that an\n> \"i-Sister City\" relationship would benefit South Florida's \"Internet\n> Coast\". This opportunity could be the basis for extending Florida's\n> recognition as an i-leader in the world community while building a bridge\n> of partnering and knowledge exchange.\n> \n> Potential points of common interest:\n> *\tPhysical Infrastructure: Web NAP (Network Access Point) build-out,\n> co-location service development, tie-in with inter-continental fiber\n> infrastructure.\n> *\tInnovation Zones: Business exchange and information sharing\n> concerning technology economic development, new markets (ASP,\n> cross-cultural multi-media, web infrastructure), incubation, investment\n> and market entry.\n> *\tEducation and R&D: Joint efforts and shared research via Technology\n> \"Centers of Excellence\" and the exchange of ideas as part of a self-driven\n> and funded \"Virtual University\" program.\n> \n> Both regions are experiencing dynamic growth in the tech sectors and share\n> historic positions as cultural crossroads. Dubai has a trade history\n> connecting Asia, Africa, India and Europe that goes back some 3000 years.\n> In recent decades, significant investment and development have gone into\n> shipping, banking and communications infrastructure. As in Florida, Dubai\n> is now experiencing a shift to advanced Internet related technology.\n> \n> 2) Chile too.  I had dinner with Chile's President H.E. Ricardo Lagos\n> while he was on tour of Silicon Valley. He has asked me to come to Chile\n> to create tech momentum around e-gov and ASP for the purpose of economic\n> development, infrastructure improvement and creating the basis for a\n> better way of life. An appropriate linkage to enhance Florida's world\n> reputation could be incorporated into this initiative as well.\n> \n> 3) Can I help? I notice few recognized technologists listed as members of\n> Florida's Task Force on Election Procedures, Standards and Technology. I\n> offer my services if appropriate.\n> \n> I am a technology advisor to IDEA (International Institute for Democracy\n> and Electoral Assistance) in Stockholm, Sweden. Thus, I am familiar with\n> some of the issues. I believe that my insight in technology may be of use\n> to Florida.\n> \n> Sincerely,\n> Traver\n> \n> Traver Gruen-Kennedy - Chief Strategist and Vice President, Strategy\n> Citrix Systems, Inc., 6400 NW 6th Way, Fort Lauderdale, FL 33309\n> T 954.267.2542   F 954.267.2563   traverk@citrix.com   www.citrix.com\n> and \n> Chairman, ASP Industry Consortium\n> www.aspindustry.org   www.allaboutasp.org\n> \n> To schedule calls and meetings with Traver Gruen-Kennedy please contact: \n> Laurie Hammell-Crosta    T 954.267.2310    laurie.hammell@citrix.com\n> \n> \n> \n> About Dubai Internet City -  www.dubaiinternetcity.com\n> Mission: To provide an infrastructure, environment and attitude that will\n> enable New Economy enterprises to operate locally, regionally and\n> globally, out of Dubai, with significant competitive advantages. \n> \n> \n> About the Virtual University \"Center of Excellence\" Project\n> Research universities have been a cornerstone supporting many of the\n> business success stories in the technology sector.  From transistors and\n> silicon to fiber and the Web, the creativity of the academic community\n> flourishes when coupled with the dynamic world of business and\n> commercialization. The benefit to society is immeasurable.\n> \n> During his \"Broward Days - Tallahassee\" presentation in early 2000, Traver\n> Gruen-Kennedy shared his vision of creating technological \"Centers of\n> Excellence\" linking academic communities around the world with industry.\n> The concept consists of creating a virtual community of like interests on\n> specific technology topics such as optical networking, multimedia, ASP,\n> alternative energy and biotech.  Since that time a variety of\n> constituencies have professed interest in pursuing the concept including\n> Florida Atlantic University (Boca Raton), the University of Houston\n> (Texas), York University (Toronto), Bellingham University (Washington),\n> Cornell University (New York) and universities in the UK, Japan, New\n> Zealand and Australia.\n> \n> During the first half of 2001 it is anticipated that the Virtual\n> University \"Center of Excellence\" Project will begin its formal\n> organizational phase.  First an international conference will be organized\n> in which the academic and tech communities will come together to share\n> perspectives and points of interest.  Out of this event will come action\n> items and taskforces formed for the purpose of establishing this global\n> virtual entity. It is anticipated that student and professorial exchange,\n> distance learning, funded research, information repositories, structured\n> technology transfer and degree programs will result.\n> \n> About IDEA - www.idea.int\n> Created in 1995 by 14 countries, International IDEA promotes and advances\n> sustainable democracy and improves and consolidates electoral processes\n> world-wide.

Haven't Florida officials learned anything after the debacle a couple of years ago regarding the state's having contracted to sell Floridians' driver's license photos to a private security firm?\n\nI'm certain that you will recall that the public was so outraged by the invasion of privacy that you stopped the sale and canceled the contract. But now  <http://www.sptimes.com/News/122300/Opinion/Licensed_drivers_at_r.shtml> a new project in Pinellas county <  <http://www.sptimes.com/News/122300/Opinion/Licensed_drivers_at_r.shtml> http://www.sptimes.com/News/122300/Opinion/Licensed_drivers_at_r.shtml > would utilize the photos of all Florida drivers in an Orwellian, perpetual, digital-face-recognition system.\n\nWhen someone agrees to have their picture taken for a Florida driver's license, Governor, they haven't given their consent, implicit or otherwise, to being part of a perpetual state wide criminal suspect file. I certainly didn't, did you? . It's a classic example of function-creep, where the government collects information for a stated purpose but then uses it in other ways. \n\nFederal law now protects driver's license information from distribution without the motorist's consent. Although a specific voter mandated amendment to Florida's State Constitution specifically prohibits unwarranted government snooping on Florida citizens, there is an exception for law enforcement. Any law enforcement agency, including the Secret Service, can request the record and photo of anyone suspected of and/or charged with a crime. However, \"blocks\" of drivers license data as are contemplated by the Pinellas county database scheme, have never before  been released to any agency or individual.\n\nMaybe it's time to tighten the law enforcement exemption. Our driver's license photos are not police mug shots. \n\nYour attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated. \n\nKindest Personal Regards,\n\nOwen\n\nOwen Whitman\n\nWebmaster\n\n <http://www.hotpolitics.com> HOTPOLITICS\n\nhttp://www.hotpolitics.com",

You\nmust be justifiably pleased and proud.\n\nThe Commission's Year 2000 accomplishments are modest, but we have\nsucceeded in developing consensus among building officials, home builders,\nproduct manufacturers and the insurance industry on the remaining building\ncode issues.  We anticipate little controversy, if any, when the Legislature\nconsiders the Commission's recommendations.\n\nWe completed our review of the code requirements that were questioned during\nthe rule adoption proceedings.  We revised the code in some instances and\nremained firm in others.  Two formal challenges were filed and both were\nresolved through negotiated settlements.  We have now finalized the building\ncode and moved to file the rule with the Secretary of State.  It is\nimportant to note that our southeast Florida counties remain satisfied that\ntheir hurricane protection standards are preserved in the new code.\n\nWe have also reached consensus on the implementation principles for the\nbuilding products approval system which the Legislature directed us to\nsubmit.  This has been a difficult issue and you may remember it is one that\nMiami-Dade and Broward Counties feel is critical to effective hurricane\nprotection.  Their participation in developing a statewide approval system\nhas been constructive and we expect their cooperation when the system is\npresented to the Legislature.\n\nLooking back, the amount of effort that has gone into the development of\nthis new building code system has surprised everyone.  The hours of toil\nand the commitment brought to this project by a broad range of individuals\nhas been an inspiration for us all.  It shows the best of what can be\naccomplished through public/private partnerships.\n\nThank you for your administration's support and your personal vote of\nconfidence in trusting me to represent you on this Commission.  We are\nconfident that with your leadership and the Legislature's help this\nCommission will continue to strive for excellence and have a major positive\nimpact on the quality of our built environment.\n\nNin\u00f3n and Raul, Jr. join me in wishing you, Columba, George, Noelle and\nJeb, Jr. a healthy and happy New Year.\n\nSincerely,\nRaul L.

Initially, what we saw when this administration first\ntook office in 1999 was a rapid detoriation in the nursing home, HMO and\nhospital sectors-due primarily to federal budget cuts in Medicaid/Medicare\nreimbursements and wrong-headed regulatory changes from HCFA.\n\nThe good news is that we have seen some dramatic improvements.\n\nThe overall Index has improved from being down -29% at the end of 1999 to\nup29% in 2000.\n\nIn the HMO sector, which ended 1999 down 19 % and closed 2000 up 58%,  the\ngains stemmed from HMOs exiting money-losing Medicare/Medicaid HMO markets\nand raising premiums from 8-20%.\n\nThe Hospital sector also showed great gains from bein down 14% at the end of\n1999 to a 2000 close of up 47%.  These gains are mostly due to hospitals\nselling off non-essential services, consolidation and the recent budget deal\nwhich will increase reimbursements from the feds.\n\nThe Nursing Home sector showed slight improvement from down 71% in 1999 to\ndown 57% at the close of 2000.  2000 having seen Genesis, Integrated Health\nand mariner declare Chapter 11 and Vencor struggling to emerge from Chapter\n11.  The liability insurance crisis still looms darkly over this sector.\n\nThe Pharmaceutical sector showed a slight improvement from 1999's down 26%\nto down 22%.  Pharma companies are under pressure from states being forced\nto negotiate better rebates, install price controls, and or buy more\ngenerics as a result of runaway Medicaid deficits caused largely by inflated\ndrug costs.\n\nThe regulatory and policy changes the Agency has instituted over the past\ntwo years has been a stabilizing force in an incredibly chaotic industry.\nWhile there is still much work to do, this administration can be quite proud\nof the creative, innovative and far-sighted leadership the Agency has shown\nin Florida, as well as in the rest of the U.S.\n\nJohn P.

AB1785 requires pro-homosexual tolerance education at all public schools and all grade levels, including Kindergarten. A similar bill going into effect, AB1931 will provide taxpayer funded grants to take children on field trips to teach them diversity and tolerance of homosexuality. \n\nTo counter this assault upon the rights of many parents whose personal or religious beliefs do not agree with this non-academic instruction, the Pacific Justice Institute launched today its Parental Opt Out Program. This program will provide a standard opt out form for parents wishing to ensure that their children are not exposed to such controversial and potentially harmful social instruction. In addition, the Pacific Justice Institute is offering free emergency legal counsel to all parents either having questions about the form or facing these controversial school activities. \n\"Without question, California is a pluralistic state with parents having a wide range of values regarding what is best for their children,\" said Brad Dacus, president of the Pacific Justice Institute. \"It is our goal to ensure that the public school districts in this state will still respect such diversity in view of these controversial laws.\"\nParents wishing to order a copy of this opt out form can do so by contacting the Pacific Justice Institute at our toll free number - 888/305-9129. Please feel free to forward this press release to any person you feel would be impacted by these new laws.\n\nThe Pacific Justice Institute is a non-profit 501(c)(3) legal defense organization specializing in the defense of religious freedom, parental rights, and other civil liberties.",

The event will begin with a kick-off dinner on Wednesday evening\nfollowed by highly focused forums on both Thursday and Friday mornings.\nThe sessions will be led by CEOs from various industries who will share\ntheir personal experiences on a variety of proven methods of creating\nshareholder value.  Following the morning sessions at the conference, Chase\nguests may take advantage of a variety of specially arranged activities\nthat will accommodate both skiers of all levels and non-skiers alike.  We\nwill conclude the conference with a luncheon on Friday afternoon.  I will\nalso be sending you a copy of last year's conference brochure via\ninteroffice mail.\n\nI've also attached last year's attendee list for your review.

Since what they do is so similar to what my program does, it was interesting to talk with her. \n\n\nDr. DuRocher confirmed that you are registered for the Spring semester.  I made sure that they have your correct e-mail address.  She said your teachers are: \n\n\nMary McCool, Physical Fitness \nPatsy Rayburn, Life Management Skills \nColleen Dugan, Business Systems Technologies I \n\n\nYour teachers will be calling you soon to welcome you and to make sure you understand how to participate (so, please get your days and nights turned back around immediately!)  Dr. DuRocher said you will be able to access anything you need for the courses on line, or else the Florida High School will send it to you. \n\n\nAt my request, Dr. DuRocher also put you in English I, although that course was not technically listed as being available.  Your teacher for that course will be Linda Williams.  This is great news since English is a basic course you need.  Since it is a two-semester course, you will be working on it over the summer, which I told Dr. DuRocher was fine.  She had many encouraging and positive things to say about homeschooling and opportunities for homeschoolers that I will discuss with you tonight when I get home. \n\n\nFollowing is a very nice letter written by our Governor Jeb Bush to Florida High School students: \n\n\n \n  \n\n\nThe Florida High School mission statement says a lot: \n\n\nThe mission of The Florida Online High School is to take full advantage of current instructional technology and the rapidly expanding resources of the Informational Age to provide comprehensive educational programs which will enable students to become productive, life-long learners.\n\nThis morning you said you could not believe how persistent I am in pursuing what I believe in: lifelong learning is a very important part of that.  So is sorting out values and life priorities, as you are going through now.  I am very pleased with the thoughtful way you are doing it which shows you continue to be your own person (like five or six years ago when you stayed carnivore while the rest of us went vegetarian).   \n\nWe have much to be thankful for: not the least of which is that we live in a state where you can learn through homeschooling and on-line education, in the comfort of your own room, as you wisely pointed out to me.

Our outstanding\nattorney, Jean Hartman, led an exhaustive and comprehensive process (in\ncoordination with the Sports Foundation and blessed by Sen. Latvala)  to\nevaluate applications and certify eligible facilities for retained spring\ntraining franchises.  I am very satisfied with the outcome of the selection\nprocess and feel it is correct and fair.  Sen Latvala concurs.\n\nSeven applications were received, two were deemed ineligible per criteria\nset up in law.  The remaining 5 met all criteria for certification (fyi,\ncriteria laid out below).  These five include:  Indian River County, City of\nDunedin, City of Lakeland, City of Clearwater, and Osceola County.  The two\nunsuccessful applications came from City of Bradenton and Charlotte County.\nSen. Latvala contacted Sen McKay several weeks ago to review the issues\nwhich made these two applications ineligible per statute.  I plan to\npersonally call the ineligible applicants and discuss the rationale for our\ndetermination on Tuesday.\n\nBradenton was ineligible because its current lease is only through 2011\n(with a lease extension commitment letter that would exercise an option for\na five-year extension).  However, the statute requires a signed agreement\nfor 15 years minimum (i.e., a signed lease, committing the spring training\nfranchise to the facility for at least 15 years).  Second, Bradenton\nrequested that funds they already spent in 1998 be considered as the local\nmatch.  However, the required local match of 50% must consist of funds to be\nspent in the future and be specifically intended to match the state-awarded\nfunds awarded henceforth.\n\nCharlotte Co. was ineligible because its current lease was only through the\n2001 spring training season--with a term sheet (not signed lease) that would\nextend the period of the lease through 2017.  However, again, the statute\nrequires a signed agreement (i.e., lease) committing the spring training\nfranchise to the facility for at least 15 years.\n\nBoth applicants were contacted and given the opportunity to secure a 15\nsigned lease with their respective teams to no avail.\n\nWe intend to send out letters on Tuesday, per law, to announce our\ndetermination on certification unless we hear otherwise.  Once certified,\nthose successful facilities are able to receive specified funds pursuant to\nSection 212.20, Florida Statutes.    The reporters have been biting at the\nbit to get info on this.\n\nPam\n\n\n---------------------------------------\nCRITERIA TO BE MET FOR CERTIFICATION\n\nPer statute, prior to certifying an applicant as a \"facility for a retained\nspring training franchise,\" the Office of Tourism, Trade, and Economic\nDevelopment must determine that:\n1.\tA \"unit of local government,\" as defined in Section 218.369, Florida\nStatutes, is responsible for the acquisition, construction, management, or\noperation of the facility for a retained spring training franchise or holds\ntitle to the property on which the facility for a retained spring training\nfranchise is located.\n2.\tThe applicant has a verified copy of a signed agreement with a\nretained spring training franchise for the use of the facility for a term of\nat least 15 years.\n3.\tThe applicant has a financial commitment to provide 50 percent or\nmore of the funds required by an agreement for the acquisition,\nconstruction, or renovation of the facility for a retained spring training\nfranchise. The agreement can be contingent upon the awarding of funds under\nthis section and other conditions precedent to use by the spring training\nfranchise.\n4.\tThe applicant has projections, verified by the Office of Tourism,\nTrade, and Economic Development, which demonstrate that the facility for a\nretained spring training franchise will attract a paid attendance of at\nleast 50,000 annually.\n5.\tThe facility for a retained spring training franchise is located in\na county that is levying a tourist development tax pursuant to Section\n125.0104, Florida Statutes.",

It is a Home Health Agency, which is apparently not in existence now, at least in Dunedin).\nPlease explain how Blake Medical Center rates two provider codes(one obviously false), when most health care providers have only one.

There are presently three active, \nmajor, commercial airports in South Florida - Miami International [MIA], Ft. \nLauderdale International [FLL] and Palm Beach International [PBI]. They are \nconnected by road, Interstate 95 and Florida's Turnpike and are approximately \n60 miles apart. A recent report indicated that PBI, although already fully \ndeveloped, is experiencing a drop in usage. The infrastructure is in place to \nexpand existing airport facilities, if necessary.\nMeanwhile, I have twice stayed for a week at the Marine Resources Development \nMarineLab in Key Largo, and learned much about the danger to, and destruction \nof, the sea grasses, the mangroves and the coral reef. I also recently spent \na day at the Royal Palm area of the Everglades National Park, where the \nnative bird population is already declining. \nThe very real threats to the Florida Keys Marine Sanctuary, the Everglades \nand other natural habitats posed by a new commercial airport, must be \nrecognized. It would be an ecological disaster, not only to Florida, but to \nthe entire country, to create a new development that would further degrade \nthis area that is so vital to the quality of life of all the inhabitants, the \nbirds, the fish, humans and the Florida flora. My grandchildren vary in age \nfrom 18 years to 4 months. Some have already visited the Keys and the \nEverglades. It is too easy to reflect that environmental damage takes time, \nand therefore today's adults would not appreciably suffer from inadvertent or \nintentional destruction of natural habitats. Should we take the position that \nif commercial gain is the only criteria, then let us not worry about adverse \neffects 40 or 50 years from now? \nI believe not! I would like to leave a legacy that enables the children and \ngrandchildren of my grandchildren to enjoy, appreciate and benefit from the \nnational treasures that are South Florida today.\nThere are viable commercial alternatives. We do not need to be \n\"anti-development,\" but we do need to be pro-environment. \n\nSincerely,\n\nMalcolm Lauder.",

What Paige meant when he told the Houston Chronicle on May 22, 1998: \"[A \nlimited voucher program] doesn't weaken public school systems, it strengthens \npublic school systems.\" This comment is used by virtually every right-wing \npro-voucher group to claim growing support for vouchers in minority \ncommunities.\n\n.

This controversy grew from a request in 1999 \nby Dr. Leon Spivey of Life Ministries Christian Academy to accept students \n(and funding) for what he claimed was a \"new\" preparatory school, but one \nwhich would operate in the same building and with the same programs as the \npre-existing religious school.\n\nLynn did commend Paige for his willingness earlier this year to respond to \nthe complaints of church-state separationists that Bible and Jesus-oriented \nbulletin boards at the Paul Revere Middle School be taken down. Paige wrote \nto a Texas atheist group: \"The material was immediately removed.The \nrequirement of the separation of church and state is an important tenet. I \nbelieve in and support its enforcement.\"\n\nConcluded Lynn, \"Americans deserve to know exactly what the head of federal \nprograms for education believes about diverting public dollars to religious \nuse.\"\n\nAmericans United is a religious liberty watchdog group based in Washington, \nD.C. Founded in 1947, the organization represents 60,000 members and allied \nhouses of worship in all 50 states.\n\n-30-\n\n\n____________________________________________\nBeth Corbin\nNational Grassroots Organizer\nAmericans United for Separation of Church and State\n518 C Street, N.E.\nWashington, D.C.  20002\nPH:   202-466-3234\nFAX:  202-466-2587\ncorbin@au.org\nAUcorbin@aol.com\nwww.au.org\n\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\nContent-Disposition: attachment;

Our outstanding\nattorney, Jean Hartman, led an exhaustive and comprehensive process (in\ncoordination with the Sports Foundation and blessed by Sen. Latvala)  to\nevaluate applications and certify eligible facilities for retained spring\ntraining franchises.  I am very satisfied with the outcome of the selection\nprocess and feel it is correct and fair.  Sen Latvala concurs.\n\nSeven applications were received, two were deemed ineligible per criteria\nset up in law.  The remaining 5 met all criteria for certification (fyi,\ncriteria laid out below).  These five include:  Indian River County, City of\nDunedin, City of Lakeland, City of Clearwater, and Osceola County.  The two\nunsuccessful applications came from City of Bradenton and Charlotte County.\nSen. Latvala contacted Sen McKay several weeks ago to review the issues\nwhich made these two applications ineligible per statute.  I plan to\npersonally call the ineligible applicants and discuss the rationale for our\ndetermination on Tuesday.\n\nBradenton was ineligible because its current lease is only through 2011\n(with a lease extension commitment letter that would exercise an option for\na five-year extension).  However, the statute requires a signed agreement\nfor 15 years minimum (i.e., a signed lease, committing the spring training\nfranchise to the facility for at least 15 years).  Second, Bradenton\nrequested that funds they already spent in 1998 be considered as the local\nmatch.  However, the required local match of 50% must consist of funds to be\nspent in the future and be specifically intended to match the state-awarded\nfunds awarded henceforth.\n\nCharlotte Co. was ineligible because its current lease was only through the\n2001 spring training season--with a term sheet (not signed lease) that would\nextend the period of the lease through 2017.  However, again, the statute\nrequires a signed agreement (i.e., lease) committing the spring training\nfranchise to the facility for at least 15 years.\n\nBoth applicants were contacted and given the opportunity to secure a 15\nsigned lease with their respective teams to no avail.\n\nWe intend to send out letters on Tuesday, per law, to announce our\ndetermination on certification unless we hear otherwise.  Once certified,\nthose successful facilities are able to receive specified funds pursuant to\nSection 212.20, Florida Statutes.    The reporters have been biting at the\nbit to get info on this.\n\nPam\n\n\n---------------------------------------\nCRITERIA TO BE MET FOR CERTIFICATION\n\nPer statute, prior to certifying an applicant as a \"facility for a retained\nspring training franchise,\" the Office of Tourism, Trade, and Economic\nDevelopment must determine that:\n1.\tA \"unit of local government,\" as defined in Section 218.369, Florida\nStatutes, is responsible for the acquisition, construction, management, or\noperation of the facility for a retained spring training franchise or holds\ntitle to the property on which the facility for a retained spring training\nfranchise is located.\n2.\tThe applicant has a verified copy of a signed agreement with a\nretained spring training franchise for the use of the facility for a term of\nat least 15 years.\n3.\tThe applicant has a financial commitment to provide 50 percent or\nmore of the funds required by an agreement for the acquisition,\nconstruction, or renovation of the facility for a retained spring training\nfranchise. The agreement can be contingent upon the awarding of funds under\nthis section and other conditions precedent to use by the spring training\nfranchise.\n4.\tThe applicant has projections, verified by the Office of Tourism,\nTrade, and Economic Development, which demonstrate that the facility for a\nretained spring training franchise will attract a paid attendance of at\nleast 50,000 annually.\n5.\tThe facility for a retained spring training franchise is located in\na county that is levying a tourist development tax pursuant to Section\n125.0104, Florida Statutes.",

            "message": "Last week I asked the question, \"Should the hyphen be used \nto describe individuals such as \"African-American\", \n\"Hispanic-Ame4rican\", \"German-American\", etc?\"  I've \nprobably received more responses to this question than I \nhave for any other in the past few months.  Thought you \nmight be interested in reading some of the E-mail responses \nI've received.\n\n.   The rather recent emphasis of,\"(country of \norigin)-American\" serves to only diminish that a person is \nan American. After all, being an American, in and of \nitself, denotes one of having come from some foreign shore \nsometime in his/her past. In my opinion, the only ethnic \ngroup having a valid claim to that type of title would be \nthe American Indian as \"Native American\" and even then \nwithout the use of a hyphen.\n\n.   Personally, hyphens in a name cause my eyebrows to \nrise.\n\n.   Why, I ask, are these people resorting to this \"be \ndifferent\" form of identity? And too often what I find \nemerging are semi-hidden agendas.\n\n.   We have become a nation spoiled beyond measure. A \nclassic is found in the arena of \"me-ism\". The right to \nstand apart and do your own thing Regardless  of a \ndeference to a larger good is not what set this country in \nits infancy apart from its neighbors. Our founding fathers \nset aside their personal wants  for a greater good and in \nso doing became even more recognised as valued \nindividuals.\n\n.   We all should be proud to claim the title of American \nand not stoop to bastardize it with any addition regardless \nof our heritage. Cherish and\nHonor your personal past to be sure, and more power to you; \nbut always give precedent to that which I hope you claim to \nbe a part of first.\n\n.   When one is so enamored with one's heritage that it has \nto dilute the American we all should be, then I invite that \nperson to return to their roots and leave America to the \nAmericans!\n\n.   I personally do not see why we even call, or for that \nfact, recognize, the name African American or Spanish \nAmerican. In this case I should be called English American. \nOr to go even further back, German English American. Surely \nsomewhere back there I must be related to the English  \nCrown!        \n\n.   Although  both of my parents are English, I was born in \nAmerica. I am an American and very proud of it. I will, \nexcept in very few cases, be willing to bet that 98% of \nblacks can't even  say that they were born in Africa and \nthat 60% of Spanish related were born in a Spanish country. \nIf you were  born here then you are an American, nothing \nelse. Well- maybe a  traitor.      \n \n.   Should the hyphen be used to describe individuals such \nas \"African-American\", \"Hispanic-American\", \n\"German-American\", etc?  I say, \"Sure, if they are \nresidents holding dual citizenship\".  On the other hand, if \nthey are merely trying to disassociate themselves from \nmainstream American values, I say, NO WAY!  We have more \nthan enough divisive problems in this land without creating \nadditional ones on our own.  If being an American, isn't \nsufficient national identity for an individual, let us \ngently remind that individual that the right to migrate \nfrom the United States is one which the founding fathers \nforesaw as one as necessary as the right to self- \nrepresentation before the Law.  In short, if one finds the \nAmerican political and social climate too stifling, freedom \nto leave for one more to that individual's particular \nsocio-persuasion is a right which will never be denied.  In \nshort, \"Like it of leave it!\"\n\n\n.   In answer to your question of the week, we think that \nAmericans should be called just that, Americans.  We feel \nthat insisting on the use of terms like \"'African-' \nAmerican,\" etc., simply magnifies our differences  instead \nof encouraging people to rise above them.  America is  \ncalled a  melting pot because we're all from someplace \nelse, but we can work  together if we put aside our the \nthings that divide us.  It's important to remember and \ncelebrate the customs, history, and culture of our \nfamilies--after all, these things are part of what makes us \nwho we are.\n\nHowever, we should be proud to be called Americans, and, no \nmatter what culture we came from, we should proudly \ncelebrate America's uniqueness in the world. \n \nThank you for your good work on our behalf.  We appreciate \nyour regular reports keeping us up to date on business in \nour state.  God bless you, and have a happy and healthy \n2001. \n \n.   No, All Americans regardless of background should be \nknown as Americans, period.  By dividing Americans into \nclasses i.e. the census, we use this info to divide and \npolarize the country.  The Democrats are experts at this \ntype of divisiveness.\n \n.   How about Tax-Paying Americans...\n \n.   Absolutely NOT.  if these people desire to be Americans \nthey should drop the hyphenated nonsense.  Consider this \nGerman-Russian-French-English-Latvian-American.  What could \nbe more foolish?\n\n.   In response to your questions about dividing the \nnationals ...All people who settle in America and become \ncitizens should be proud enough of their new country (and \nsome older Americans) to gladly accept just plain American. \n Nothing prohibits each nationality from celebrating their \ncultures but this is America and we should all be called \njust plain American.  And while we are on the subject of \nAmericanism... Let's insist that all foreign persons \nseeking citizenship and who desire to vote in the American \nelections read, write and speak English our native \nlanguage. Have a Happy New Year and I too feel our new 2001 \nwill bring good things to all of us, especially with George \nW. Bush assuming the presidency on Janunary 20, 2001.\n\n.   Is Confederate-American going to be added to the list? \nLest we forget, it once was a country with leaders, a \nConstitution and an army too!\n\n.   I do believe that our pledge of allegiance states: \"I \npledge allegiance to the flag of the UNITED States of \nAmerica and to THE republic for which it stands. 'ONE' \nnation, under God with liberty and justice for 'ALL'. \nTherefore, there is no such thing as a hyphenated \nAmerican!\n\n.   A question back to you: With emphasis on the hyphen or \nthe hyphenated word preceding American?  (i.e. \nAfricanAmerican w/no hyphen vs. separating oneself as being \nother than just an American)  Not counting South, Central, \nor Latin American, of course. Wow, we should call ourselves \nNorth American! \n\n.   As with all issues, there's more than 1 side; & here as \nmany as 63 according to US Census Bu form choices. \n\n.   Let's see, I think I'm: Swedish-Irish-Dutch- possibly \nScots & NA Indian-American. Bottom line? I'm white \nAnglo-Saxon mongrel, otherwise known as JUST PLAIN \nAMERICAN. The blacks take the month of Feb. Indians have a \ncouple weeks in Nov. A week is reserved for the Latinos, \nuhm in Sept? Octoberfest is for the Germanic peoples. WHY \nNOT HAVE A FESTIVAL JUST FOR BEING AMERICAN? Nope, not July \n4th. Not diverse enough. \n\n.   You wouldn't believe some of the answers I got while \ndoing Census door-to-door. Looking at someone face-to-face \n& hearing their sometimes obviously ridiculous answers was \nshocking - & they were serious! \n\n.   This isn't meant to be snappish, but satirical. The \nhyphens separate, segregate, & polarize us. To be truly the \npeaceable kingdom of the \"great melting pot\" is to drop the \nprefixes & get about the business of building an even \nbetter-than-the-best country in the world. \nThank you for your time. Sure you're gonna get some heated \nreplies to this one. :-) \n\n\nAPPRECIATE:   The above are a sampling of those I've \nreceived.  Do appreciate the fact that so many took time to \nrespond.  I'll do another FOURTH DIMENSION towards the \nlatter part of the week.\n\nComments to jmelvin@gulf1.com\n\nKeep up with the latest news and information from Northwest \nFlorida on Gulf1. http://www.gulf1.com\n\nFor AOL Users: \n<a href=\"http://www.gulf1.com\">Gulf1</a>\n\nIf you wish to be remove from this mailing list send an \nE-mail to webmaster@gulf1.com with \"Remove Jerry Melvin\" in \nthe subject line.",

I am very satisfied with the outcome of the selection\nprocess and feel it is correct and fair.

These five include:  Indian River County, City of\nDunedin, City of Lakeland, City of Clearwater, and Osceola County.

However, the statute requires a signed agreement\nfor 15 years minimum (i.e., a signed lease, committing the spring training\nfranchise to the facility for at least 15 years).  Second, Bradenton\nrequested that funds they already spent in 1998 be considered as the local\nmatch.  However, the required local match of 50% must consist of funds to be\nspent in the future and be specifically intended to match the state-awarded\nfunds awarded henceforth.\n\nCharlotte Co. was ineligible because its current lease was only through the\n2001 spring training season--with a term sheet (not signed lease) that would\nextend the period of the lease through 2017.  However, again, the statute\nrequires a signed agreement (i.e., lease) committing the spring training\nfranchise to the facility for at least 15 years.\n\nBoth applicants were contacted and given the opportunity to secure a 15\nsigned lease with their respective teams to no avail.\n\nWe intend to send out letters on Tuesday, per law, to announce our\ndetermination on certification unless we hear otherwise.  Once certified,\nthose successful facilities are able to receive specified funds pursuant to\nSection 212.20, Florida Statutes.

Details are outlined on the attached Fact\nSheet.  The event will begin with a kick-off dinner on Wednesday evening\nfollowed by highly focused forums on both Thursday and Friday mornings.\nThe sessions will be led by CEOs from various industries who will share\ntheir personal experiences on a variety of proven methods of creating\nshareholder value.  Following the morning sessions at the conference, Chase\nguests may take advantage of a variety of specially arranged activities\nthat will accommodate both skiers of all levels and non-skiers alike.  We\nwill conclude the conference with a luncheon on Friday afternoon.  I will\nalso be sending you a copy of last year's conference brochure via\ninteroffice mail.\n\nI've also attached last year's attendee list for your review.

And, I am sure that you have been through a stressful time in your life, and I congratulate you and your family for their strenght and professionalism in finally bringing this election time to a closure.  \n      Just reciently Captain Bob Carr, a captain from the Charlotte County Sheriff's department, flew our  President Elect's secret service agents to Boca Grande this past holiday.   He is now no longer with the Sheriff's department.   In conjunction with the presidential election, local elections were held and our county residents have elected a new Sheriff.  Along with that, many many changes have occurred.  Some with no logical reason.   One of which is the forced retirement of Bob Carr.  \n       I met Bob about 5 months ago.  He approached me about helping him and a few others on training a mounted patrol for our county.  I agreed to help them as I felt it sure would be a real asset to our community in many ways.   Though this training process, I got to know Bob both as a professional and as a real person and friend.   He is truly an honest and caring person.   He uses these personal attributes in his work as a Captain in the Sheriff's department.  I also learned that he was a Warrant Officer in the Army and flew in Vietman.  He is a war veteran!   He served our country in Vietnam from 1970 - 71 as a helicopter pilot.  He started his law enforcement career in 1979 in Charlotte County, THIS is 20 YEARS of service.  He is 3 1/2 years from full retirement.   I cannot believe that our society could treat someone that has given this country and my community so much service with this much disrespect.   They destruction of the families is incredible!   One reporter from the newspaper stated \"the blood letting has begun\".   I am writing to you and asking you to please help!  This certainly is a great injustice.  I do know that he was to fly you somewhere on the day he lost his job.   It's too bad that you didn't have the opportunity to meet him.    I want to add that he was TOTALLY responsible for our county's aviation program, in which the sheriff's department is threatening on down sizing.   He is responsible for the restoration of a Huey Helicopter \"5-0-Deuce\", a helicopter he flew in Vietnam!  The restoration of this aircraft was done without public funds and is owned by the sheriff's department.   The community is concerned with the fate of the aircraft. They are feared that the sheriff's department will destroy the aircraft by painting it the sheriff's department colors.   I KNOW  that Bob and many other veteran's donated thousands of dollars and long hours to restore this helicopter.   PLEASE, help save this helicopter, it is a memorial to our veterans!\n      Sir, Bob has so many good qualities, has spent so many years in law enforcement and has so many years experience, he belongs working for our community's Sheriff's department!    People in our community need more Bob Cars.  If I call for help, I sure hope that it will be someone with the qualities and experience that Bob Carr has.  Thank you so much for you time and consideration in this matter.  I will be awaiting for your reply or actions.\n \nSincerely \nPaulette Stoudt, horse trainer, Sand Cay Farm, Punta Gorda, FL\n941-628-0169\nwww.sandcayfarm.com\nemail  sandcay@strato.net \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely,\nPaulette Stoudt\npaulette@sandcayfarm.com\nhttp://www.sandcayfarm.com <http://www.sandcayfarm.com/>",

For a\nnational \"first\":\n\n1.  Re-engineer the motor vehicle and vessel regulations to replace the\nsecure title document with a plain paper title, since the electronic\nrecord is now the official record.\n\n2.  Discontinue the annual vehicle and vessel registration and the\nbureaucracies, processes, materials and records required.\n\n3.  Use a very small addition to gasoline taxes to replace the lost\nrevenue for the public stakeholders, state and county governments.  This\nwill spread the cost over highway users, whether or not they reside in or\nown a vehicle in the State of Florida.\n\nGovt. costs eliminated: Tamper-proof secure title paper, $250,000/year,\nplus costs of storage, distribution and inventory control.\t        \t     Mail registration renewal notices, $750,000/year.\t\t        \t     Decals and registration forms, $1,000,000/year\n\nThese estimates are very conservative.  Costs of data collection, storage\nand retrieval are not included, nor costs of program management and problem resolution.\n\nAdditional public benefit: Expired decals will no longer be a matter for\nthe attention of police agencies.\n\nAdditional individual taxpayer benefit: One less governmental procedure\nwith which to comply, and annual savings of $1,000,000 or more for\nregistration (postage, travel or Internet transaction fee) plus cost of\nlate fees and fines for missed registration deadlines.  This could be a high profile reduction in government impact on citizens.\n\nImpact on other stakeholders:  Prison industries (PRIDE) is increasingly\noffering technology services, as the workforce switches from material\nproduction to technology.  Since decals are now being printed as issued\nin county tax collector offices (the new program is about 50% in place)\nPRIDE's role was decreasing anyway.  Manufacturer (3M): Hard to see a\nplus from their point of view.  However, license plate quantities and\nprices seem to increase annually, and they sell the overlay material for\nthat.  However, we should look at reducing tag demand too, perhaps by\nextending the five-year replacement requirement, and allowing tags to\nremain with vehicles through successive owners.  County govts: As\nindicated, fuel taxes could be managed to provide the needed revenues,\nwhile the effort required at the local level is eliminated.  Since tax collectors are taking on responsibilities for issuing driver licenses, this could free up time to lessen any impact of their DL responsibilities.  And, the DL responsibilities will generate county revenue.\n\nI realize this is a rough outline and there may be other considerations I've missed.  Please use or discard as appropriate.  If you'd like someone to discuss this with me, I'm at 488-8290.\n\nRuss Rothman, Chief of Purchasing & Contracts, Dept of Hwy Safety & Mtr Veh\n________________________________________________________________",

Haven't Florida officials learned anything after the debacle a couple of years ago regarding the state's having contracted to sell Floridians' driver's license photos to a private security firm?\n\nI'm certain that you will recall that the public was so outraged by the invasion of privacy that you stopped the sale and canceled the contract. But now  <http://www.sptimes.com/News/122300/Opinion/Licensed_drivers_at_r.shtml> a new project in Pinellas county <  <http://www.sptimes.com/News/122300/Opinion/Licensed_drivers_at_r.shtml> http://www.sptimes.com/News/122300/Opinion/Licensed_drivers_at_r.shtml > would utilize the photos of all Florida drivers in an Orwellian, perpetual, digital-face-recognition system.\n\nWhen someone agrees to have their picture taken for a Florida driver's license, Governor, they haven't given their consent, implicit or otherwise, to being part of a perpetual state wide criminal suspect file. I certainly didn't, did you? . It's a classic example of function-creep, where the government collects information for a stated purpose but then uses it in other ways. \n\nFederal law now protects driver's license information from distribution without the motorist's consent. Although a specific voter mandated amendment to Florida's State Constitution specifically prohibits unwarranted government snooping on Florida citizens, there is an exception for law enforcement. Any law enforcement agency, including the Secret Service, can request the record and photo of anyone suspected of and/or charged with a crime. However, \"blocks\" of drivers license data as are contemplated by the Pinellas county database scheme, have never before  been released to any agency or individual.\n\nMaybe it's time to tighten the law enforcement exemption. Our driver's license photos are not police mug shots. \n\nYour attention to this matter will be greatly appreciated. \n\nKindest Personal Regards,\n\nOwen\n\nOwen Whitman\n\nWebmaster\n\n <http://www.hotpolitics.com> HOTPOLITICS\n\nhttp://www.hotpolitics.com",

This message is in\ncase the following is significant as well:\n\nThis morning when I was driving to work (c. 8:00 a.m.) along my usual route,\nI noticed a dead animal on the side of the road.  It was unusual because it\nwas snow white.  This is an area where one expects to see (and I have seen)\nfox, opossum, armadillo, raccoon, otter, sand hill cranes, bob cat, even a\ncoyote... but not a domestic-looking animal, unless it would be a cat.  I\nthought at first it was a rat, and out of curiosity, turned around and drove\nback to see for sure.  It was a white rabbit, either a young one or a dwarf\nvariety.  There was no sign of blood, and the animal had apparently died of\nblunt trauma: it almost appeared to be sleeping.\n\nEven though the dead white rabbit in a very rural area seemed most out of\nplace, it was not until I noticed the following that I decided to mention it\nto you: the place where it was located bi-sects the distance between the\nintersection of Hudson Avenue and Hays Road (where I turn south, toward\nTampa) and the intersection of Hays Road and SR 52/Schrader Memorial Highway\n(where I turn east, toward Tampa).  I clocked it twice just to be sure: it\nwas just over 1.1 miles in each direction.\n\nSymmetry possibly being a significant factor, and dead things at the side of\nthe road already having proved to be, I thought it might be important to\npoint out this white rabbit.  I don't, of course, know what -- if\nanything -- it means.  I can't help but wonder, though: what is the\nlikelihood of seeing a white rabbit in that area, and given that, what is\nthe likelihood, on chance alone, it would have fallen where it did --\nmidpoint between two intersections I pass nearly every day, and in fact,\nwhere I make a decision?\n\nKim",

Both were prostitutes and their bodies were stuffed into suitcases and left in plain sight along public roads. They have also been linked to the same Miami motel.   Kim, nickname for Kimberly.   Dr. George B. Livesay was the academic dean at Clearwater Christian College, and my first boss in Florida.  We were just talking about him the other day.  Sia is odd, bears certain resemblance to Tia \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the nickname my daughter changed to because so many mispronounced Thea, the short form of Matthea I had assigned.  Dietz and Demas, I am not sure about.  The ages were not meaningful at the times of these murders, except 35 is 53 backwards, the age you were going to be, and 21 is the age Tia had just been.  The manner in which their bodies were left mirrors apparent surrogate victim situations where display was apparently an important feature \u00e2\u0080\u0093 the particular display could vary.  \nPolice said they have been met with mixed reactions, including some hostility, while visiting the men. About 30 detectives are investigating the deaths and have researched more than 250 leads.   Thirty detectives to investigate the murders of two prostitutes, and all we get regarding the murder of our virtuous, elderly mother is continuing close outs, including from Governor Jeb Bush, via Marty McDonnell, most recently!  This is offensive in the extreme, Connie!  In fact, Mother could not even get any help when she, herself, was crying, \u00e2\u0080\u009cStop murdering me!\u00e2\u0080\u009d  \nPolice also have looked up registered sex offenders in the area and visited them as well, along with contacting international police and questioning former associates of the two women.  \n``People think that just because it's a prostitute who was murdered, we don't take it seriously,'' said Sgt. Robert O'Neil of the Broward County Sheriff's Office homicide unit.   \n``But any murder of a human being is of a serious nature. We investigate it as seriously as the murder of a high-profile businessman.''   Our history of experience with the United States government on down, which includes, of course, the State of Florida, exposes this statement as a bald-faced lie. What evidence is there to the contrary?  \nDetectives had met problems in the investigation because the most likely tipsters, other prostitutes and drug abusers, often are unreliable.   Maybe those who have ready access to information that can be used in profiling are the better ones to look at.  \n``They have a hard life,'' said Detective David Frisbie of the Cooper City Police Department, also part of the task force. ``It's a brutal world they live in.'' \nThe FBI has been involved, with detectives wanting a profile done of the likely killer. The FBI ran the two slayings through the Violent Criminals Apprehension Program, a nationwide database of crimes and victims.   Maybe it wasn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t the same person.  Maybe it works like different seamstresses using the same pattern.  Maybe they need to look for the pattern maker(s).  To such an entity:  Of what use is a prostitute whose name happens to be Kim?  Of what use is a little boy whose name happens to be Zachary?  Of what use is a 26-day old infant whose family happens to call him Bobby?  Of what use is a governor whose term is up?  If not as surrogate victims, what use are any of them?   \nAn electrician found the body of Dietz- Livesey on June 22 in a suitcase in Cooper City.

Aug 10, 2000\nDetectives say the victim's tattoos and the manner in which the body was found are eerily similar to a case from less than two months ago.\nFor the second time in two months, a passer-by found the nude body of a tattooed-woman stuffed inside a piece of luggage left on the side of a Broward roadway.\nThe latest discovery came Wednesday morning when a woman walking her dog stumbled upon a bulging black, 4-foot-long duffel bag left in plain sight just yards from the Broward Medical Examiner's Office near Dania Beach.  The location \u00e2\u0080\u0093 close to the Medical Examiner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office \u00e2\u0080\u0093 is most likely very significant.  Also, a woman I used to go to church with at Grace (Scot St.) was, like me, a seamstress.  One of the seamstress stories she shared with me was that a man had hired her to make some large, heavy-fabric (denim or canvas, I think) bags.  He explained that they were to put 55-gallon drums in, an explanation she did not question.  As it turns out, he was murdering people (women in Ohio, I think) and using the bags to put the bodies in.  Ultimately, he was arrested.  Fibers from the fabric were found, where he had dragged the bodies in the bags along the concrete.  My friend had to go to court to testify: she still had scraps from the bags she had sewn for him, and was able to associate them with him.  Her husband\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name was Dave \u00e2\u0080\u0093 I can\u00e2\u0080\u0099t remember their last name just now.  They used to own the property at the corner of Hudson Avenue and Hicks Road, where the Circle K and that strip mall just north of it are now.  Their barn is still standing \u00e2\u0080\u0093 we had a few church hootenannies in there.  Dave died of a heart attack at a young age: early forties, I think.  I am sure I have told this story to a number of people.  The last I heard, she had remarried and moved out somewhere off of Kitten Trail (Theresa Blvd., I think).  \nInside was the body of a white female with dark brown hair and green eyes. Broward County Sheriff's Office investigators identified the victim late Wednesday as Sia Demas, 21, of Wilton Manors. She was 5 feet 6 and weighed 149 pounds. She had four tattoos: the word \"Philly\" on her right wrist, \"Titi\" on her left, \"Drew\" on her right calf, and a peace sign, heart symbol and smiley face - all in a row on her left leg.  Green eyes sounds like Chrystyna, although her hair is more blondish brown.  She is from Philadelphia.  \u00e2\u0080\u009cTiti\u00e2\u0080\u009d is a nickname we have used for Tia within the family.  Drew can be short for Andrew (Nathan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s middle name) and is also the name of one of Dad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relatives who used to live in this county: Drew Satterfield, wife\u00e2\u0080\u0099s name Dee.  Peace sign is from my era, heart symbol is sort of universally familiar.  Our dad always said that Josiah reminded him of Mr. Smiley face \u00e2\u0080\u0093 with his round-faced grin.  Is Hart the last name I am trying to think of?  We have a neighbor Dave Hart here on Owen.  Chrystyna has a tattoo on her ankle: a butterfly, I think.  Where and when did Demas get the tattoos?\nAn autopsy concluded that Demas was murdered. Authorities did not immediately make public the cause of death.\nDemas had a criminal record, according to sheriff's spokesman Jim Leljedal, including \"several charges, most of them drug related and some prostitution related.\" He said she had served some jail time.  This would be consistent with apparent surrogate victims who have had previous involvement with judicio-legal or health and human services entities \u00e2\u0080\u0093 virtually all of them, Mildred Boroski and Janis Beryl McDonnell possibly being among the exceptions.  \nDetectives said Demas' tattoos and the manner in which her body was found are eerily similar to the case of Kim Dietz-Livesey, a 35- year-old Miami woman whose body was found seven weeks ago inside a brown canvas suitcase on the side of Flamingo Road north of Sheridan Street in Cooper City. She too had four tattoos - including a few roses and a dragon - on her arms and legs. She was 5 feet 6 and weighed 120 pounds.  Seven weeks between cases repeats a significant number: 7.  What other roads are close to Flamingo?  Albatross was about one street away from Flicker, where Kimberly Langlois Wilson\u00e2\u0080\u0099s body was found: Alba Trouss, of course, being very significant in regard to Bill Webb.  There might have been a Flamingo there too.  Roses, of course, are my symbol and have been all my life.  The dragon is interesting \u00e2\u0080\u0093 my nickname as Dragonlady, perhaps?  Or Nathan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Chinese horoscope figure?  Our cat, whose name was Dragon (so named by Gavin Reid Fornof).  \n\"There are really a lot of similarities,\" said Robert Cates, the Cooper City Police detective who has been searching for leads in the Dietz-Livesey case. Cates and other Cooper City detectives were at the scene where the duffel bag was found, taking photographs and talking to forensic investigators.\n\"We need to sit down with Broward Sheriff's Office and go over both cases to determine if there is any connection,\" Cates said.\n\"There are a million other places in South Florida that are less conspicuous. Why on the side of the road?\"  Because the drama and the display were essential, particularly in that timeframe: the detectives need to think like professional terrorists.  Terror is the name of the game: the more terror, the better.  The methods can \u00e2\u0080\u0093 and do \u00e2\u0080\u0093 vary.  Who stands to benefit most from such terrorization?  And why?   \nLeljedal confirmed the Demas and Dietz-Livesey cases are being investigated together based on the similarities.  Demas and Dietz both start with D and have five letters: like David (David Walter Fornof?): an oddity that may or may not mean anything.  \nThe passer-by was walking her dog just after 7 a.m. on Southwest 31st Avenue when she came upon the bag.  Seven, again, and 31, one of our birthday numbers.  \nPolice partially unzipped the bag and saw a human back.\nThe bag lay in plain sight about 50 yards south of the Broward County Medical Examiner's Office. So close, that forensic investigators wheeled a gurney from the office, picked up the bag with the body inside and rolled the gurney back to the office for an autopsy.  This reminds me of Kathy A. Struckoff \u00e2\u0080\u0093 within insulting distance to the Sheriff\u00e2\u0080\u0099s office, and within close timeframe to when we had met with him.  What was the date of Joan Wood\u00e2\u0080\u0099s resignation letter, and my e-mails to Jeb about all that? Was there a timeframe correlation?  The Demas murder might have looped back to the Dietz-Livesey one in that regard, just as though the Dietz one had also been found in close proximity to the Medical Examiner\u00e2\u0080\u0099s Office. What I mean is, even if the resignation was not until after the Dietz case, by virtue of being before the Demas one, and that one being so similar in other ways to the Dietz one, the first would gain correlation with the second and vice versa.  Since I have switched computers and don\u00e2\u0080\u0099t have all my files transferred, I cannot easily look this up right now: I just have a feeling it\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a detail that ought to be considered.        \nThe duffel bag was taken to the Broward Sheriff's Office crime lab where technicians searched for fingerprints, DNA residue or any other evidence that may lead to the woman's identity and her cause of death.  Was it a store-bought duffel bag, or homemade?\nIn the Dietz-Livesey case, police still have no suspects in the June 22 death. Investigators said she died of blunt head trauma.  Like Jennifer Renee Odom?  And how many others?  \nShe was the mother of a toddler and a former retail store manager who lived in El Portal in north Miami-Dade. Two weeks before her death, she had been arrested in Miami on prostitution charges. Police have not arrested anyone in the case, and an $11,000 reward from her family and Crimestoppers is being offered for any leads that result in an arrest.  Miami would associate her with Jeb and Columba\u00e2\u0080\u0099s former home place.  During this timeframe, it did not really have a strong relevance to me and mine, although I had traveled to Broward (April, I think).  \nNews of Wednesday's case gave Michael Livesey, Kim's husband who is caring for their 17-month-old daughter, hope that police may be able to find her killer.  Michael is another family name: Michael Edward Cieszynski.  Seventeen (17) is our number \u00e2\u0080\u0093 several birthdays, as well as the seventh, and therefore, holiest prime.  \n\"I am really sorry this happened to someone else,\" he said. \"People don't normally die this way. Hopefully, they will find a link between them and find whoever is doing this.\"\nThe deaths are among several cases in the past few years involving women who were killed and their bodies left in Broward.  Broward starts with B and has seven letters, like Blevins.  John and Christopher have both spent a lot of time in Ft. Lauderdale (Chris calls Ft. Slaughterdale) during this past year.  \nIn May 1999, Delia Lorna Mendez, a Broward prostitute, was found cut in half in a trash bin in Hollywood.  It could be that the only relevant thing about her being a prostitute is that she was considered expendable as a profiled surrogate \u00e2\u0080\u0093 but then, who isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t in the current, lawless system that prevails?  Delia is another name that starts with D and has five letters: I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m not convinced that would figure to be significant, but it is there, so I point it out.  \nA few months before, the body of Sheila Griffin was discovered in a vacant lot in the 1300 block of Northwest Second Street in Fort Lauderdale. She had been strangled.  Griffin is a form of one of our family names.  The thirtee
